      In the wake of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mixed-messages/like-the-flu-trumps-coronavirus-messaging-confuses-public-pandemic-researchers-say-idUSKBN2102GY">mixed-messaging</a> from the federal government,
      state governors have taken the lead in response to Covid-19.
      <br><br>
      On a state-by-state basis many of those actions look quite different. Some of this makes sense. In Washington, one of the first states hit by a significant community spread vector in late February, Governor Jay Inslee was one of the first to
      declare a state of emergency. Mississippi, meanwhile, only closed school on Thursday, March 19th (This despite the governor himself being self-quarantined).<br><br> California’s on lockdown, Montana is finally out of denial, and Virginia thinks
      a
      <a href="https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Gov-Northam-set-to-address-Virginia-after-51-confirmed-COVID-19-cases-2-deaths-568862491.html">10-person limit</a> in bars and restaurants is enough to do the trick.

      You can check out gubernatorial responses in this map. Just mouse over each state to see what policies have been enacted. Darker states indicate a more aggressive state response.
